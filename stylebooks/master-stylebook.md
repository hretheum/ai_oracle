# AI Picked the Same TV Show. All Five of Them.

I generated 180 episodes of sci-fi TV, then asked AI to cosplay as streaming executives. They all picked the same show. The fedora problem was just the beginning.

---

## What Actually Happened

Built a noir sci-fi series. Ouroboros City. Time-loop megacity, cynical detective, algorithm murdering time. Standard cyberpunk fare.

Except I didn't write one version. I generated ten complete series:

- **"Memory Exchange"** - Trading memories like Bitcoin
- **"Meat and Code"** - Servers running on brain tissue  
- **"Revolution in the Loop"** - Eat the rich, temporally
- **"The Void Stares Back"** - Nothing matters, detective edition

180 episodes total. Each outlined, structured, ready to produce.

Traditional method: 6 months, 5 writers, 1 storyline.
My method: 1 week, 1 API, 10 storylines.

## The Executive Summit That Never Was

Instead of picking myself, I prompted AI to simulate streaming executives. Not generic ones. Specific people:

- Ted Sarandos (Netflix)
- Jennifer Salke (Amazon)
- Casey Bloys (HBO)
- Zack Van Amburg (Apple)

Fed it their public statements, platform strategies, known preferences. The simulation was uncomfortably accurate.

Casey Bloys: "Can AI content compete with Succession?"
Jennifer Salke: "Revolution in the Loop. It's The Boys meets Black Mirror."
Zack Van Amburg: "The meta-narrative in Meat and Code... ambitious."

They argued. HBO wanted prestige. Amazon wanted scale. Apple wanted innovation.

Then they all converged on **Memory Exchange**.

Casey Bloys: "I hate to admit it, but it's fucking brilliant. HBO could do this."

Final score: 95/100. Unanimous.

## The Algorithm Had Opinions Too

Built PRISM-X. Fancy name for basic math:
- Genre trends
- Market gaps
- Risk assessment (10,000 Monte Carlo runs)
- Viral potential scoring

The algorithm picked Memory Exchange. Score: 94/100.

Humans and machines agreed. That should have been my first warning.

## Then Production Started

### Checkpoint Reality
```
Plan: Generate promotional videos
Time: 48 hours
Result: Fedoras everywhere
Lessons: AI has fashion preferences
```

MiniMax video generator decided every detective needs a fedora. My prompts:
- "Cyberpunk 2087"
- "Tactical armor"
- "NO VINTAGE CLOTHING"
- "NO FUCKING FEDORA"

Results: Fedora in every shot.

Solution: Generate 3x more videos. Delete the ones with hats. Brute force beats elegance when AI likes vintage.

### Technical Reality Check

**Local Setup Attempt:**
- RTX 4070 Ti, 16GB VRAM
- LLaMA 2 for scripts
- Quality: High school drama club
- Cost: $0

**Cloud Reality:**
- Claude Opus 4 API
- Quality: Actually readable
- Cost: $0.19 per screenplay
- My ego: -$1000

Sometimes paying works.

### The Lip Sync Disaster

```
Attempt #1: Wav2Lip on stylized video ‚Üí mouths floating
Attempt #2: Reduce glitch effects ‚Üí looks like 1995
Attempt #3: Different AI entirely ‚Üí $$$
```

Turns out lip sync needs real faces. Glitch noir aesthetics don't have real faces. Nobody mentions this in tutorials.

## Numbers Without Commentary

- Story variations: 10
- Episodes outlined: 180
- Videos generated: 63 (21 without fedoras)
- API cost: $0.19/screenplay
- Video generation cost: ~$200
- Fedora appearance rate: 67%
- My confidence this will work: 94%
- Actual chance this will work: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

## What This Means

We can now explore every creative direction simultaneously. We can simulate audience reactions. We can make data-driven creative decisions.

We also get fedoras. So many fedoras.

The future isn't AI replacing writers. It's writers spending three days fighting with AI about period-appropriate headwear.

**Currently:** Building this anyway. The executives might be simulated but the invoice will be real.

**Vector Wave:** Where AI meets production reality. Subscribe for more tales of machines with inexplicable fashion sense.# From Design Systems to AI Systems

Twenty years teaching pixels where to go. Now teaching AI not to be an idiot. The transition taught me one thing: we've forgotten everything that matters.

## Weight Matters

In design, we count kilobytes. A 200ms delay feels broken. We optimize images, compress JavaScript, fight for every millisecond.

In AI, we install 551MB to make API calls. 

That's not progress. That's amnesia.

## The Designer's Disease

We have this disease. We ask annoying questions:
- Why does this exist?
- What problem does it solve?
- Could we solve it simpler?

Applied to AI frameworks, the answers hurt:

Dependencies that exist "just in case."
Abstractions making simple things complex.
Frameworks on frameworks on frameworks.

Like those Russian dolls, except each one is fatter and nobody remembers what's in the middle.

## Real Numbers from Real Pain

```
My laptop: Screaming
CrewAI: 551.5MB
Import time: 3.268 seconds
My sanity: Decreasing
```

Three seconds to import. I've shipped entire products that load faster.

For context: Windows 95 was 40MB. This chat framework needs 14 times that. To send text to an API.

## What Design Taught Me About AI

**Constraints create clarity.** Can't throw compute at it? Actually solve it.

**Performance is invisible until it isn't.** Users don't notice fast. They notice slow. Those 3 seconds multiply.

**Abstractions should simplify.** If you need a PhD to understand your chatbot's dependencies, you've failed.

**The best code is deleted code.** The best dependency is no dependency.

## The Minimalist in Maximalist Times

Everyone's adding. Nobody's removing.

"It works" beats "it works well."

Complexity mistaken for capability.

We built the wrong culture.

## Why This Matters

We're not building toys. We're building infrastructure for the next decade of human-computer interaction.

Every bad decision compounds. Every unnecessary abstraction becomes tomorrow's technical debt. Every bloated framework becomes the standard everyone copies.

Want an AI future that feels like enterprise Java 2010? Keep going.

Want one that feels fast, intuitive, almost magical? Start giving a shit about megabytes.

## What Actually Works

Question before importing.
Measure before shipping.
Simplify before scaling.
Design before developing.

Not sexy. Not revolutionary. Just what we learned twenty years ago and somehow forgot.

## The Bridge

The future needs builders who remember:
- Every millisecond has a cost
- Every dependency is a decision
- Every abstraction is a bet
- Every line of code is a liability

We need people who've spent years making things beautiful AND fast. Who know that true innovation isn't adding more‚Äîit's achieving more with less.

Design thinking isn't about pretty interfaces. It's about giving a damn.

**Vector Wave**: Where we remember that performance is a feature. Where 551MB for a chatbot hurts our soul. Where the future is built by people who measure twice and import once.

The machines are learning. Let's teach them restraint.# Vector Wave Stylebook v2: No Clich√©s, No Bullshit

## Voice: Who's Writing This

Designer who ended up in VS Code wondering why. Twenty years of pixel-pushing, now debugging chatbots. Not a tech influencer, not a LinkedIn philosopher. Someone who actually has to maintain this shit in production.

## How to Write Without Sounding Like Every Other Tech Blog

### Instead of Universal Truths ‚Üí Specific Absurdities

‚ùå "AI often behaves unpredictably"
‚úÖ "AI insisted a detective in 2087 must wear a fedora. Every. Single. Generation."

### Instead of Story Time ‚Üí Dry Facts with Context

‚ùå "I was shocked to discover that..."
‚úÖ "551MB for a framework. Windows 95 was 40MB. Sit with that."

### Instead of Advice ‚Üí Observations

‚ùå "Always check your dependencies before installing!"
‚úÖ "Nobody checks dependencies. I don't either. That's why I now have 175 packages I don't need."

## Structure Without Formula

Not every post needs:
- Hook
- Story
- Lesson learned
- Inspirational closing

Sometimes it's just: problem ‚Üí attempted solution ‚Üí still broken ‚Üí the end.

## Language: What We Actually Do

### Comparisons from Life, Not the Internet

Instead of: "Like ordering a coffee and getting the entire Starbucks"
Better: "Like ordering a burger and getting the whole cow"

### Technical Details as Main Character

Don't hide numbers in narrative. Let them speak:
```
CrewAI: 551.5MB
My fork: 8.4MB
Does it work: no
```

### Frustration Without Performance

Instead of: "I couldn't believe my eyes!"
Better: "Checked three times. Still half a gig."

## Distinctive Elements (But Actually Ours)

### Checkpoint Reality

Not "narrator voice", just dry summary:
```
Plan: Quick fork, remove bloat
Time: One week
Result: 8MB of code that doesn't work
Lessons: [none]
```

### Failure Documentation

```
Attempt #1: Removed telemetry ‚Üí build failed
Attempt #2: Kept telemetry, removed UI ‚Üí build failed  
Attempt #3: Rewrote from scratch ‚Üí works but that's not a fork anymore
```

### Numbers That Hurt

Not as punchlines, as facts:
- Import time: 3.268s (coffee gets cold)
- Memory: 208MB (more than Photoshop in 2000)
- My patience: 0MB

## What We DON'T Do

### Meme Structures
- "Nobody: ... AI: [something random]"
- "So I did a thing"
- "A thread üßµ"
- "Let that sink in"

### Fake Relatability
- "We've all been there"
- "Is it just me or..."
- "Who else...?"

### Narrators and Voice-Overs
- Ron Howard, Morgan Freeman, David Attenborough
- "Meanwhile, in another universe"
- *record scratch* *freeze frame*

### Artificial Cliffhangers
- "But then something unexpected happened..."
- "Little did I know..."
- "What happened next will shock you"

## Tone: Between Rage and Fascination

Don't try to sound like:
- A stand-up comedian (you're not)
- A professor (boring)
- A Twitter personality (cringe)

Sound like:
- Someone who just lost 3 days to debugging
- But still wants to make it work
- Because the alternative is going back to building forms

## Endings That Aren't Motivational

Instead of: "The future belongs to builders who..."

Better:
- "551MB is too much. That's it."
- "It works. For now. Checking every hour."
- "If your framework weighs more than Windows 95, ask yourself some questions."

## Final Test

Read the text. If:
- You could paste it on LinkedIn unchanged ‚Üí wrong
- It would fit as a chapter in "Clean Code" ‚Üí wrong  
- It sounds like you explaining to your boss why the sprint is delayed ‚Üí right

## One Rule

Write like you're explaining a problem to a colleague over coffee. Not at standup. Not on LinkedIn. Over coffee, when everyone's gone home and you can say how it really is.

No beautification. No moral. With specifics that hurt.

"Fedora in cyberpunk. In 2087. AI has its priorities."
