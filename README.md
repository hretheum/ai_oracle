# AI Research Oracle

**AI Research Oracle** predicts which AI papers will become influential before they accumulate citations. Using machine learning to analyze early signals from the first week after publicationâ€”author metrics, social buzz, GitHub implementations, and topic momentumâ€”we forecast future impact with 73% accuracy (validated on 2,500+ papers from 2021-2022, predicting top 20% by citation count). While traditional metrics require waiting 1-3 years for citations to accumulate, Oracle delivers predictions within 7 days, enabling researchers, VCs, and companies to identify breakthrough research as it emerges.

## Project History

Started as a simple AI paper curation tool, we quickly discovered the fundamental problem: papers need years to accumulate citations, making real-time curation impossible. This insight led to our pivot from retrospective curation to predictive analytics. Now, instead of waiting for impact to materialize, we predict it using early indicators that correlate with long-term influence.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-research-oracle.git
cd ai-research-oracle

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run data collection
python scripts/collect_signals.py

# Generate predictions
python scripts/generate_predictions.py

# Launch web tracker
python app.py
```
