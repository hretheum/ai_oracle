# 📋 Project Context - AI Research Oracle Roadmap

## Current State
This file contains the context needed to continue the roadmap documentation in a new conversation.

## What's Been Completed

### ✅ Created Files:
1. `/docs/roadmap/ROADMAP_MASTER.md` - Master roadmap with 7 phases
2. `/docs/roadmap/phase_0_foundation.md` - Foundation setup (accounts, DB, env)
3. `/docs/roadmap/phase_1_data_collection.md` - Data collection pipeline
4. `/docs/roadmap/phase_2_ml_development.md` - ML model development

### 📝 Remaining Files to Create:
1. `phase_3_mvp_launch.md` - MVP Launch (predictions, tracker, newsletter)
2. `phase_4_growth_automation.md` - Growth & full automation
3. `phase_5_optimization.md` - Model optimization & scaling
4. `phase_6_premium.md` - Premium features & expansion
5. `daily_standup.md` - Daily standup template
6. `issues.md` - Issue tracking template
7. `metrics.md` - Metrics dashboard template

## Continuation Prompt

To continue creating the roadmap documentation in a new conversation, use this prompt:

```
I'm continuing work on the AI Research Oracle project roadmap. The project is located at:
/Users/hretheum/dev/bezrobocie/growth automation/

Current status:
- Master roadmap created at: docs/roadmap/ROADMAP_MASTER.md
- Completed phases 0-2 documentation
- Need to create phases 3-6 and supporting templates

Please continue by creating:
1. phase_3_mvp_launch.md - Following the same detailed, atomic task structure as phases 0-2
2. Continue with remaining phases if context allows

Each phase should include:
- Atomic tasks with 15-60 min durations
- Clear validation criteria
- Quality gates between blocks
- Troubleshooting guides
- Success metrics

The project is about building an ML system that predicts which AI research papers will be influential based on early signals (first 7 days), instead of waiting years for citations.
```

## Key Information to Remember

### Project Goal
AI Research Oracle - ML system predicting future impact of AI papers using early signals (author metrics, social buzz, implementations) instead of waiting 3 years for citations.

### Success Metrics
- 70% prediction accuracy within 20% margin
- 5,000 newsletter subscribers in 6 months
- 20 API beta users
- 10+ media mentions

### Technical Stack
- Make.com for automation
- Airtable for database
- Python/scikit-learn for ML
- Railway for API hosting
- ArXiv, Semantic Scholar, GitHub, Twitter APIs

### Phase Structure Template
Each phase document should have:
1. Overview & success criteria
2. Task blocks with atomic tasks
3. Quality gates between blocks
4. Troubleshooting guide
5. Completion checklist
6. Metrics tracking
