# Gamma.app Pitch Deck Prompt - AI Research Oracle

## Version: Full Transparency (July 2025)

```
Create a pitch deck for AI Research Oracle - a CONCEPT for an ML system that could predict paper impact.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- This is PRE-LAUNCH, no users yet
- No validated accuracy (target: 70%)
- Solo founder, part-time project
- $250/month projected costs when operational

TONE: Honest about stage, clear about assumptions, zero fake metrics

SLIDE STRUCTURE:

Slide 1: Title
"AI Research Oracle: Can We Predict Paper Impact?"
Subtitle: "Early-stage concept seeking validation"

Slide 2: The Problem I Noticed
- Spent 100+ hours reading AI papers last year
- 90% turned out irrelevant after 2 years
- Current tools show citations AFTER they accumulate
- What if we could predict impact early?

Slide 3: The Hypothesis
Early week 1 signals might predict long-term impact:
- Author track record (h-index, affiliation)
- Quick GitHub implementations
- Social media buzz
- Technical novelty markers
Need to validate: Do these actually correlate?

Slide 4: Proposed Solution
1. Track papers from publication
2. Collect signals for 7 days
3. ML model predicts future citations
4. Public tracking builds trust
5. Learn and improve from results

Slide 5: Why This Might Work
- Similar approaches in other fields:
  - Box office predictions from opening weekend
  - Stock momentum indicators
  - Social media virality patterns
- Key question: Does research follow patterns?

Slide 6: Development Plan
Phase 1 (Month 1): Validate correlation exists
- Analyze 1,000 historical papers
- Check if early signals predicted success

Phase 2 (Month 2-3): Build MVP
- Basic prediction model
- Test with 100 beta users

Phase 3 (Month 4-6): Iterate
- Improve accuracy
- Find product-market fit

Slide 7: Business Model (If It Works)
Target Users: AI researchers, R&D labs
Pricing Hypothesis:
- Free: 5 predictions/month  
- Pro: $19/month unlimited
- Team: $199/month with API

Break-even: ~1,000 paying users
(Big assumption: researchers will pay)

Slide 8: What I Need to Learn
1. Do early signals actually predict impact? (30% chance: no)
2. Will researchers pay for predictions? (unknown)
3. Can I achieve 70%+ accuracy? (technically challenging)
4. Is the market big enough? (maybe just a nice small business)

Slide 9: Realistic Outcomes
Best case: $50k MRR in 2 years, acquisition by Elsevier
Likely case: $10k MRR, sustainable small business
Worst case: Signals don't work, pivot or shut down

Not trying to be a unicorn. Just solving a problem I have.

Slide 10: Current Ask
Looking for:
- 10 researchers to interview about the problem
- Access to citation data for validation
- Technical advisor with ML experience
- $10k to cover 6 months of development

DESIGN NOTES:
- Simple, clean slides (like academic presentation)
- No fake dashboard screenshots
- Include actual sketch/wireframe at most
- Focus on the problem and hypothesis
```

## Alternative Versions

### Version 1: Original (DO NOT USE - Contains Fake Metrics)
- Had 73% accuracy claim without validation
- Showed 487 subscribers that didn't exist
- 15 slides (too long)

### Version 2: Improved but Still Optimistic
- 10 slides
- More realistic but still assumed traction
- Better risk disclosure

### This Version: Full Transparency (RECOMMENDED)
- Admits it's pre-launch concept
- Clear about what needs validation
- Honest about risks and unknowns
- Appropriate for early-stage pitch

## Usage Instructions

1. Go to [gamma.app](https://gamma.app)
2. Create new presentation
3. Paste this prompt
4. Customize with your actual contact info
5. Review and adjust design to taste

## Key Principles

1. **Never claim what you haven't proven**
2. **Be clear about assumptions**
3. **Show the journey, not fake destination**
4. **Focus on problem validation first**
5. **Realistic about market size**

## Timeline Context

As of July 2025, this project is in concept stage:
- Phase 0 (Foundation): July 19-21
- Phase 1 (Data Collection): July 22-28
- Phase 2 (ML Development): July 29 - Aug 4
- First real metrics: Expected August 2025

Update this prompt with real data as you validate assumptions.
