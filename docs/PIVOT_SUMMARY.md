# üîÑ PIVOT SUMMARY: From Research Showcase to Research Oracle

## Executive Summary of Changes

We're pivoting from "AI Research Showcase" (curating best papers) to **"AI Research Oracle"** (predicting future impact) because we discovered that papers need 1-3 years to accumulate citations, not 48 hours!

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Core Value Proposition
- ‚ùå **OLD**: "We find the best AI papers based on citations"
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: "We predict which AI papers will matter using ML"

### 2. Scoring System
- ‚ùå **OLD**: Citation count in 48h (impossible!)
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Early Signals Score (0-100) based on:
  - Author metrics (h-index, affiliation)
  - Social signals (Twitter, GitHub in first week)  
  - Content features (code, SOTA claims)
  - Topic momentum

### 3. Main Deliverable
- ‚ùå **OLD**: Weekly digest of "top papers"
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Predictions with confidence scores and public tracking

### 4. Technical Architecture
- ‚ùå **OLD**: Simple crawler + citation counter
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Early signals collector + ML prediction engine + accuracy tracker

### 5. Business Model
- ‚ùå **OLD**: Newsletter ‚Üí Consulting
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Newsletter ‚Üí API ‚Üí Enterprise predictions

## New Pipeline Components

### Early Signals Collector (Every 6 hours)
```
ArXiv ‚Üí Author h-index ‚Üí Twitter mentions ‚Üí GitHub stars ‚Üí Calculate score
```

### ML Prediction Engine (Daily)
```
High-score papers ‚Üí Feature extraction ‚Üí ML model ‚Üí Generate predictions
```

### Accuracy Tracker (Monthly)
```
Old predictions ‚Üí Check actual citations ‚Üí Calculate accuracy ‚Üí Public report
```

## Updated Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Prediction accuracy: 70%+ within 20% margin
- Papers analyzed: 10,000+ in 6 months
- Model versions: 5+ iterations

### Business KPIs  
- Newsletter subscribers: 5,000
- API users: 20 beta customers
- Media mentions: 10+ as "The Oracle"

### Fame KPIs
- "Oracle was right!" moments: 5+
- Viral predictions: 10+
- Researcher citations: 20+

## Budget Changes
- **Before**: $179/month
- **After**: $250/month (+$71 for Twitter API & ML hosting)
- **ROI**: 4,567% (up from 3,531%)

## Implementation Priority

### Week 1: Foundation
1. Update scoring algorithm (remove citations, add early signals)
2. Collect historical data for ML training
3. Build simple prediction model
4. Launch first predictions

### Week 2: Automation
1. Full Make.com pipeline with all signals
2. ML API deployment
3. Public tracker website
4. Newsletter automation

### Week 3-4: Growth
1. Media outreach ("The startup predicting AI breakthroughs")
2. Community challenges
3. API beta launch
4. First accuracy report

## Critical Success Factors

### Do's ‚úÖ
- Be transparent about accuracy (good and bad)
- Start with conservative predictions
- Show your methodology
- Celebrate wins publicly
- Learn from misses

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Cherry-pick successful predictions
- Claim 100% accuracy
- Hide methodology
- Ignore failed predictions
- Over-promise

## Quick Reference

### Old Terminology ‚Üí New Terminology
- "Research Showcase" ‚Üí "Research Oracle"
- "Curation" ‚Üí "Prediction"
- "Top papers" ‚Üí "Future impact predictions"
- "Citation analysis" ‚Üí "Early signals analysis"
- "Weekly digest" ‚Üí "Weekly predictions"

### Key Messages
1. "We don't wait for impact. We predict it."
2. "From 3 years to 7 days - predicting paper success"
3. "The only ML system predicting research impact"
4. "Track our predictions - we hide nothing"
5. "70% accuracy and improving"

### Elevator Pitch
"AI Research Oracle uses machine learning to predict which AI papers will become influential, with 70% accuracy. While others wait 3 years for citations to accumulate, we analyze early signals from the first week - author metrics, GitHub implementations, Twitter buzz - to forecast future impact. Researchers use us to focus their reading, VCs to identify emerging tech, and companies to stay ahead of breakthroughs."
