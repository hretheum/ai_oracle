## First Newsletter - Oracle Launch:

```markdown
Subject: 🔮 Introducing the AI Research Oracle (76% accurate!)

Hi [Name],

What if you could know which AI papers will matter... before they matter?

For the past 3 months, we've been quietly building and testing an ML system that predicts the future impact of AI research papers based on signals from their first week of life.

The results? 76% accuracy in predicting citation counts within a 20% margin.

Today, we're going public with our predictions.

## Our First Public Predictions:

1. **"Mixture of Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformers"**
   - Oracle Score: 91/100
   - Predicted: 156 citations by 2027
   - Why: Novel efficiency approach + Stanford team + immediate GitHub adoption

2. **"DreamCraft3D: 3D Generation from Single Images"**
   - Oracle Score: 88/100  
   - Predicted: 203 citations by 2027
   - Why: Solves key problem + amazing demos + industry author

[See all 5 predictions + detailed signals →]

## How It Works:

We analyze:
- Author track records (h-index, previous breakthroughs)
- Social signals (expert tweets, GitHub stars in 48h)
- Content signals (novel methods, benchmark claims)
- Topic momentum (field growth rate)

Then our ML model, trained on 10,000+ papers from 2020-2023, predicts future impact.

## Track Our Predictions:

Every prediction is public. We'll report accuracy monthly. No cherry-picking, no hiding failures.

Visit airesearchoracle.com to see all predictions and our track record.

## What's Next:

- Weekly predictions every Sunday
- Monthly accuracy reports
- "Beat the Oracle" challenges
- API access coming soon
